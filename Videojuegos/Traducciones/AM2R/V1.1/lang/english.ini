Their next objectives were to explore the nearby Chozo ruins and study SR388's other wildlife. #Communication with the team was cut off and only a distress signal managed to reach HQ."

The Omega Metroid exhibits devastating strength; an impact from its claws can severely cripple or kill large animals, while the most heavily armored prey are flung through the air. #Despite its towering figure, it can leap and use its weight as a weapon. Glands in the mouth ignite its saliva, turning it into an organic flamethrower. Its membrane has greatly thickened; maximum firepower is strongly recommended.# #This is the final stage in a Metroid's lifecycle, and very few manage to reach it.
