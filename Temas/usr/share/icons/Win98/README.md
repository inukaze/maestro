Gtk98Icons
----------

Gtk98Icons is a GTK icon theme
that looks like the unforgetable Windows 98.
Most icons are ripped straight out of Windows 98. 
A few were created by myself.
It's still pretty much a WIP.

If used in Xfce together with the Redmond GTK
theme and the Redmond Xfwm theme you will end
up with a desktop that looks fairly close to
Windows 98, as shown here:
