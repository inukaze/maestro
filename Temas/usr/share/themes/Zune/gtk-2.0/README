* Fixed combo boxes so the text doesn't turn white on mouse hover
* Fixed the selected text color so the text doesn't turn white when the selection
  becomes unfocused
* Fixed the unchecked radio button graphic (it was too dark before)
* Changed the progress bar - uses XP2002's graphics but are orange not green
* Switched the arrow graphics for the one in XP2002 - more accurate for WinXP
